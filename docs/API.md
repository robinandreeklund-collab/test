# GiGi — API endpoints (beta test build)

All endpoints are Next.js route handlers under `src/app/api`. The build is
single-tenant (one seeded household), so no auth header is required; production
gates every route behind Supabase Auth and scopes to the caller's household.

## Response conventions

- Success: `{ ok: true, ... }` or the requested resource.
- Validation errors: HTTP 4xx with `{ error: "human message" }`.
- All data-returning GETs are `force-dynamic` where needed so they reflect live
  store state rather than a build-time snapshot.

## Example flows

```bash
# Approve a saving proposal
curl -X POST /api/actions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"itemId":"item_xyz","action":"approve"}'

# Add a bill by hand
curl -X POST /api/bills -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"provider":"BT","type":"broadband","amount":"55","renewalDate":"2026-10-01"}'

# Simulate tonight's nightly run
curl -X POST /api/digest/generate
```
